# Homebrew formula — installs the prebuilt boom binary (a single self-contained
# executable compiled from TypeScript via Bun). The repo doubles as its own tap:
#   brew tap alxjrvs/boom https://github.com/alxjrvs/boom
#   brew install alxjrvs/boom/boom
# The name must be FULLY QUALIFIED: bare `boom` resolves to an unrelated
# homebrew-cask entry, and brew reports it "already installed" while this
# formula is absent.
# sha256 values are filled in by the release workflow when a tag is cut.
